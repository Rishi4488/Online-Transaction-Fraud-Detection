# Online-Transaction-Fraud-Detection

## Aim
Develop a model for predicting fraudulent transactions for a financial company and use insights from the model to develop an actionable plan.

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miznaaroob/fraudulent-transactions-data

Data for the case is available in CSV format having 6362620 rows and 11 columns

## Content
First I imported all the required libraries and dataset for this project. Then I did some EDA to find which mode of transaction results into most fraudulent transactions. Then I worked throught to treat any inconsistency in the data. Then I proceeded to build the model.

### Libraies
1.Pandas - for data analysis

2.Numpy - for data analysis

3.matplotlib - for data visualization

4.seaborn - for data visualization




## Conclusion

I worked on xgboost model to classify Fraudulent and Non fraudulent transactions and I observed an accuracy of 0.9981.

I was successfully able to find the most accurate model to detect fraudlent transactions.
